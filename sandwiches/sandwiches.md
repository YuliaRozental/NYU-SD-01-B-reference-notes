# Sandwiches

Y'all did a straight-up _amazing_ job with this pseudocode activity, and it's worth memorializing. If you can break down logic this way, everything else about coding is just a matter of:

1. Being aware of what _can_ be done
2. Remembering/looking up the syntax to tell the computer to do it

1. With the knowledge that you have ingredients at home,(bread, peanut butter, jelly, plate, knife, napkin, counter space) check if you have all ingredients
2. With your right hand reach out retrieve bread from your pantry, and set it on the countertop, in the same manner, do the same to retrieve the peanut butter jar and jelly
3. Retrieve the plate with both hands and place it on the countertop
4. Untwist the bag of bread and reach into the bag and retrieve two slices of bread
5.  Place the slices of bread side by side on the plate
6. Retrieve a butter knife from where ever you keep your knives
7. Grab the jar of peanut butter with one hand and untwist the lid with your other hand, do the same for the jelly jar
8. Hold the handle of the knife and bring your knife down vertically into the peanut butter jar using a rotating motion scoop out the peanut butter and spread it evenly horizontally onto one piece of the bread, do this same step again if you want more peanut butter
9. Hold the handle of the knife and bring your knife down vertically into the jelly jar using a rotating motion scoop out the jelly and spread it evenly horizontally onto one piece of the bread, do this same step again if you want more jelly
10. Carefully with one hand lift one slice and flip it onto the other slice so the peanut butter and jelly come together
11. Gently compress  down towards the plate so they stick together (you can use the same knife to carefully remove excess peanut butter and jelly from the sides by vertically sliding the knife along each of the edges of your sandwich)
12. Pick it up and eat it
